Using MLB Pitch Data from 2015-2018 to Determine a Player’s Performance.

Much like any other sport, baseball is a game of skill, luck, matchups, and many other elements. Major League Baseball (MLB) teams spend millions of dollars every year to develop or maintain the right blend of these elements. This is all done in hopes of winning many games and ultimately a World Series title.

A team’s success, however, ultimately comes down to their player’s performance during at bats.  An at bat is defined to be a batter’s turn against a pitcher. Each at bat consists of several attempts of getting on base or hitting a home run. Given that at bats are the only way to gain points in a game, it is critical to maximize the likelihood of a successful at bat. 

In this report, we will be building a model that predicts whether an at bat will have success or not. We define a successful (or positive) at bat as one in which the batter either progresses to a base, scores a home run, or gets out but allows a teammate to progress (sacrifice). A failed (or negative) at bat would simply be one in which no progress is made and results in an out.
